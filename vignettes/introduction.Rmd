This package facilitates access to environmental data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for streamlined use in health models developed in R. The package includes functions and wrappers for basic data-wrangling tasks, such as population weighting and interpolation. The package is developed as a complement to the NOAA Climate.gov data page originally developed for Infectious Disease modeling of COVID-19, but extends to other health models and modelers.


This a test tutorial with the `DailyTemperatures` dataset.


```{r}
dailyTemperatures = read.csv(file = "E:/SecureData/CTL/R package/DailyTemperatures.csv")
