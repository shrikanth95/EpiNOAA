Description: Packag to access to environmental data from the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for streamlined use in health models 
developed in R. The package includes functions and wrappers for basic 
data-wrangling tasks, such as population weighting and interpolation. 
The package is developed as a complement to the NOAA Climate.gov data page 
originally developed for Infectious Disease modeling of COVID-19, but extends 
to other health models and modelers.
